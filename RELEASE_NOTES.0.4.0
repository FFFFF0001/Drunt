Release Notes For v0.4.0

Since dunst has lost its ability to show notifications independend of
dbus/libnotify a long time ago I think it is time that the describtion reflects
that. Even though this breaks the acronym. So if you're a packager please update
the package description to read something like:

short:
"Dunst - a dmenu-ish notification-daemon"

long:
"Dunst is a highly configurable and lightweight notification-daemon"

Release Tarballs are now available at:

For more information have a look at the CHANGELOG and the new options in dunstrc.
