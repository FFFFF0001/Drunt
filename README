NAME
       dunst - dmenu-ish universal notification system

SYNOPSIS
       dunst  [-geometry  geom]  [-fn font] [-nf color] [-nb color] [-lf color] [-lb color] [-cf color] [-cb color] [-to secs] [-nto secs] [-lto secs] [-cto secs] [-format fmt] [-key key] [-mod
       modifier] [-mon n]

DESCRIPTION
       dunst is a lightweight notification-daemon for the libnotify. It can also be used as a standalone notification system. Dnotify displays messages received via dbus or as commandline argu‚Äê
       ment in a fashion similar to dmenu and additionally prints them to stdout. Notifications can be closed via mouseclick.

OPTIONS
       -h/--help
              display help message.

       -fn font
              defines the font or font set used.

       -nb color
              defines the background color for normal messages. #RGB, #RRGGBB and X color names are supported.

       -nf color
              defines the foreground color for normal messages.

       -lb color
              defines the background color for low urgency messages.

       -lf color
              defines the forground color for low urgency messages.

       -cb color
              defines the background color for critical messages.

       -cf color
              defines the forground color for critical messages.

       -msg msg
              display msg instead of listening to notifications. This option can be used multiple times.

       -to secs
              timeout for messages with low and normal urgency. Messages with a timeout of 0 will not dissappear automaticly (defaults to 10)

       -nto secs
              timeout for messages with normal urgency (defaults to 10)

       -lto secs
              timeout for messages with low urgency (defaults to 10)

       -cto secs
              timeout for messages with critical urgency (defaults to 0)

       -key key
              close window by pressing key [a,b,space,Return etc.] (should be used in combination with -mod).

       -mod modifier
              defines  the  modifier  for the key. Available modifiers are: ctrl,shift,mod1 (usually the alt-key),mod2,mod3,mod4 (usually windows key). This option can be used multiple times to
              combine modifiers.

       -format fmt
              defines the format of the messages. See FORMAT.

       -mon n show the notification on monitor n.

       -geometry [[<width>]x<height>][+/-<X>+/-<y>]
              The geometry of the message window. The height is measured in lines everything else in pixels. If the width is omitted but the height is given ("-geometry x2"), the message window
              expands  over  the whole screen (dmenu-like). If width is 0, the window expands to the longest message displayed. A positive x is measured from the left, a negative from the right
              side of the screen. Y is measured from the top and down respectevly. see also EXAMPLES show the notification on monitor n.


NOTIFY-SEND
       dunst is able to get different colors for a message via notify-send. For that, you have to add a hint via the -h option.

       notify-send -h string:fgcolor:#ff4444

       notify-send -h string:bgcolor:#4444ff

       notify-send -h string:bgcolor:#4444ff -h string:fgcolor:#ff4444

FORMAT
       fmt is a string containing placeholders. The placeholders will be replaced with the corresponding text, or if the text is not present, nothing.  Possible placeholders are:

       %a  appname

       %s  summary

       %b  body

       %i  iconname (including its path)

       %I  iconname (without its path)

EXAMPLES
       dunst -geometry x2 Displays a maximum of two lines across the top of the screen.

       dunst -geometry x3+0-0
              Displays a maximum of three the lines across the bottom of the screen.

       dunst -geometry 0x3-30+20
              Displays a maximum of three lines 30 pixels away from the right border and 20 pixels away from the top with adaptive size.

       dunst -geometry 100x3-30+20
              Displays a maximum of three lines 30 pixels away from the right border and 20 pixels away from the top with a width of 100 pixels.
